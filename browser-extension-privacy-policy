# Privacy Policy for TakoIntel

Last Updated: 2025-05-06

Hey there! Thanks for using TakoIntel. I’m just a developer working from home, and I want to make sure you know that I respect your privacy.

### What Data Do I Collect?

The simple answer is: none. I don’t collect any personal information from you. I don’t track what you’re doing in the extension or anywhere else.

### No Tracking, No Data Collection

This extension doesn’t track anything about your browsing, and I’m not sending any data to any servers or third-party services. What you do in the extension stays private, just between you and your browser.

### No Cookies, No Fancy Tracking Stuff

I don’t use cookies, web beacons, or any of that stuff that some apps use to follow you around the web. It’s just the extension doing its job, and that’s it.

### Security

Since I don’t collect or store any data, there’s nothing for anyone to steal. All your information stays private, because there’s no information to begin with.

### Redirects to External Sites

My browser extension redirects you to websites not controlled by me. This Privacy Policy doesn't cover how those sites handle your data. Please review their privacy policies for more information.

### Changes to This Policy

If anything changes, I’ll update this privacy policy and change the last updated date. But as of now, you can count on this being a pretty straightforward, no-strings-attached extension.
